# ChariCalc
A work-in-progress Pok√©mon damage calculator.

This project is built with Python. To keep things neat, the code will be stored in several scripts and will be referred to by the main script as necessary.

The project's features currently include:
   - Type Calculator: Calculate the effectiveness of a move.
   - Dice Roller: Roll random numbers.
   - Dex Search (Incomplete): Find a POokedex number for a given name.
